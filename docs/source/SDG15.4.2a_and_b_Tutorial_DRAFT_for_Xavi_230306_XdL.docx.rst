Background
^^^^^^^^^^

SDG Indicator 15.4.2 – Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is one of the two indicators under SDG Target 15.4, which aims to "*ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, to enhance their capacity to provide benefits which are essential for sustainable development*". The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations is the custodian agency of this indicator. 

The indicator is composed of two sub-indicators to monitor progress towards the conservation of mountain ecosystems: 

**Sub-indicator 15.4.2a**, Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI), is designed to measure the extent and changes of green cover - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. – in mountain areas. MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain area of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems. 

**Sub-indicator 15.4.2b**, Proportion of degraded mountain land, is designed to monitor the extent of degraded mountain land as a result of land cover change of a given country and for given reporting year. Similarly to sub-indicator ‘’trends in land cover” under SDG Indicator 15.3.1 (Sims et al. 2021), mountain ecosystem degradation and recovery is assessed based on the definition of land cover type transitions that constitute degradation, as either improving, stable or degraded. The definition of degradation adopted for the computation of this indicator is the one established Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)footnote reference [#]_.


.. [#]IPBES defines land degradation as “the many human-caused processes that drive the decline or loss in biodiversity, ecosystem functions or ecosystem services in any terrestrial and associated aquatic ecosystems” (IPBES, 2018)


Overview of Mountain Area Map
-----------------------------

Several methodologies have been developed in the last decades to consistently classify and map global mountain systems, using a variety of parameters such as elevation, topography, climate and ecology.

For the purposes of standardization and international comparability of nationally derived-estimates, this indicator adheres to the UNEP-WCMC mountain definition (UNEP-WCMC, 2002). The UNEP-WCMC method defines total global mountain area as the sum of seven classes (commonly known as ‘Kapos mountain classes’), based on elevation, slope and local elevation ranges parameters. The mapping of mountain areas using this methodology requires a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

For disaggregation purposes, this mountain area is subdivided into bioclimatic belts as defined by Körner et al. (2011). Körner et al. subdivides mountains vertically into seven bioclimatic belts based on average temperatures, therefore accounting the latitudinal change in elevation of thermally similar areas in the world’s mountains. For the purposes of this indicator, these seven bioclimatic belts are aggregated into four (Nival, Alpine, Montane and Remaining mountain areas), as illustrated in Table 1.

**Table 1.** Mountain bioclimatic belts as defined by Körner et al. (2011) and reclassification for data disaggregation of SDG Indicator 15.4.2. Growing season is defined as the number of days between daily mean temperature exceeds 0.9 °C then falls below 0.9 °C

A global mountain area map sub-divided by bioclimatic belts has been developed by FAO and made available to national authorities to facilitate the computation of this indicator. This map is the result of combining a global mountain area map developed from the Global Multi-Resolution Terrain Elevation Data (GMTED2010), following the UNEP-WCMC methodology (Ravilious et al. 2021) and a mountain bioclimatic belt map created by the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment

Overview of the land cover data
-------------------------------

Land cover refers to the observed physical cover of the Earth’s surface. It includes vegetation and manmade features as well as bare rock, bare soil and inland water surfaces (FAO-GTOS, 2009). The primary units for characterizing land cover are categories (e.g. Forest or Open Water). These categories must be defined following a standardized land cover
classification in order to identify land cover changes consistently over time.

Several global standards of land cover classifications have been developed by international initiatives for this purpose. For the purposes of standardization and harmonization when reporting on SDG Indicator 15.4.2, this indicator has adapted the land cover classification established by the United Nations Statistical Commission’s System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (UN-SEEA)(UN Statistical Division, 2014) by selecting the most relevant SEEA classes for mountain ecosystems and aggregating all croplands classes in the following classification (Table 2).

Land cover maps developed by relevant national authorities will generally provide the most relevant data source to compute this indicator. However, in certain cases, such data may not be available. In those cases, various regional or global products provide a viable alternative.

The global default source of land cover data for this indicator is the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) Land Cover product (ESA, 2017). The ESA-CCI product consists of a series of annual Land Cover maps at 300 m resolution, providing 22 land cover classes based on 300m MERIS, 1km SPOT – VEGETATION, 1km PROBA –V and 1km AVHRR. The ESA CCI adheres to the Cover Classification System of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) (Santoro et al. 2015). Annual updates are currently available from 1992 to 2020. Additional years will be made available by the European Space Agency

Before using this tutorial
==========================

To run this workflow you will need have QGIS 3.20 or a higher version installed in your computer.

   2. .. rubric:: Defining projections to be used for the analysis
         :name: defining-projections-to-be-used-for-the-analysis

With all map projections there will always be some distortions of area,
shape, distance and direction and therefore careful selection of
projection is important. There are no projections which fully preserve
both area and distance so selection should ensure that any distortions
are minimized. In selecting the projection, we therefore need to
consider the spatial properties we need to preserve. i.e. area and
distance.

For the purposes of this analysis, in which area needs to be preserved,
an equal area projection is required. Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) is a good option for countries covering only one UTM zone as both
distance and area are minimized within the zone but as distortion
increases outside the UTM zone an alternative projection is required for
countries covering more than one zone. Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area
projection (with a central meridian and central latitude set to the
centre of the country) is good solution for these countries as area
calculations result in figures similar to those if data within each UTM
zone were projected and calculated separately for their respective zone.
Documentation for the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection indicates
that shapes, directions, angles, and distances are generally distorted,
but area distortion is minimised. If countries wish to choose an
alternative National projection, they should ensure that it has equal
area properties.

Choice of Land Cover dataset 
-----------------------------

In sub-indicator 15.4.2a, land cover is used to categorize land into
green and non-green cover areas. As showed in Table 3, green cover
includes areas covered by both natural vegetation and vegetation
resulting from anthropic activity. Non-green areas include non-vegetated
areas such as bare land, water, permanent ice/snow, urban areas and
sparsely vegetated areas.

In addition, land cover is used to disaggregate the indicator into the
10 land cover classes included in Table 2, thus increasing the
indicator’s policy relevance.

non-green cover.\ * *

Land cover maps developed by relevant national authorities will
generally provide the most relevant data source to compute this
indicator. To meet the technical quality requirements for calculating
this indicator, these land cover maps should:

-  Use a land cover legend defined using the Land Cover Meta Language
   [ISO 19144-2:2012] standard, have adequate classes to populate the
   transition matrix and be part of a hierarchical classification system
   to promote easy harmonisation to the SEEA classification

-  Be available during the 2000-2015 period and as close to the baseline
   year (2015) as possible.

-  Be produced for the whole mountain area of the country and be
   recorded at high spatial accuracy.

-  Have information on the classification accuracy for each land unit at
   each epoch of the data.

Where existing national or regional land cover products do not meet the
requirements described above, the global default dataset for this
indicator should be used. However, given unique national context and
degradation processes, it may be advantageous for a country to develop
their own land cover classification, using remote sensing imagery.

 Step-by-step instructions to calculate Sub-indicator 15.4.2a in QGIS 
======================================================================

This section of the tutorial explains in detail how to calculate value
estimates for sub-indicator 15.4.2a in QGIS, using Colombia as a case
study. This section assumes that the user has already downloaded the
global mountain map made available by FAO to compute this indicator and
a land cover dataset meeting the requirements described in section 3.2.

1. 

   1. .. rubric:: Define projection
         :name: define-projection

The first step is to define an Area of Interest (AOI) for the analysis.
This should go beyond the country boundary as outlined in
the \ **Defining analysis environments** section of the tutorial.

-  Add a country boundary layer to QGIS **Layer>>Add Layer>>Add Vector
   Layer**

|image1|

|image2|

|image3|

-  Click \ **Add** and **Close** to close the Data Source Manager:
   Vector dialogue window

-  Right-click on the country boundary layer and click \ **Zoom to
   Layer**

In this example, the boundary layer is in Geographic coordinate system
(EPSG 4326). At this stage we want to set-up the projection for the main
parts of the analysis. We therefore want to set the project window to an
equal area projection and physically project the country boundary to the
same projection.

Colombia does have a `National Projection <https://epsg.io/9377>`__ that
preserve both area and distance (see
`here <https://origen.igac.gov.co/documentos.html>`__) and therefore
could be used as a custom projection. In case a national projection that
minimize area distorsion does not exist for a given country, it is
recommended to define a custom Equal Area projection centered on the
country area following the instructions described
`here <https://mgci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qgis.html>`__ under
‘’Define projection and generate AOI’’).

Once you have defined the projection to use in the analysis, change the
projection set for the QGIS project to your chosen projection. In this
example it is the national projection for Colombia.

-  Click on the project projection \ **EPSG: 4326** in the bottom right
   hand corner of your QGIS project

|image4|

-  In the Project Properties dialogue window search for the chosen
   projection in the \ **Filter** tab, in this case the projection EPSG
   9377

|image5|

-  Once located click on the chosen projection to set your QGIS project
   to be displayed in the chosen projection.

-  Click \ **Apply** and **OK **

See that the project now displays the custom projection in the bottom
right hand corner.

|image6|

Next use the reproject tool to project the country boundary layer to the
9377 projection

-  In the processing toolbox search for the \ **Reproject** tool

|image7|

-  Set the Input layer to be the \ **country boundary**

-  Set the Target CRS to be the \ **Project CRS** (i.e. the EPSG 9377
   projection)

-  Set the output name to be the same as the input with a suffix to
   indicate the projection e.g. in this example \ **Colombia\_9377. **

|image8|

Now that the country boundary is in the chosen projection, we can
generate the mountains and land cover maps for Colombia.

 Generate the mountain map for the chosen country. 
---------------------------------------------------

The development of mountain map consists in clipping and reprojecting
the SDG 15.4.2. Global Mountain Descriptor Map developed by FAO to area
of interest, in this case, the national border of Colombia.

`Clip and project global <https://mgci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qgis.html#id23>`__ mountain map
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the QGIS main toolbar click on \ **Layer>>Add Layer>>Add Raster
Layer** to add the global mountain map file to your QGIS session.

|image9|

|image10|

-  Click \ **Add**

|image11|

-  In the processing toolbox search for \ **Clip**

-  Double click on the \ **Clip raster by mask layer** under the GDAL
   toolset

|image12|

-  Select the \ **global mountain descriptor map** for the \ **Input
   Layer**

-  Select the \ **national border of the country** for the \ **Mask
   Layer**

-  Select the \ **Project CRS** for the \ **Target CRS**

-  Tick \ **Match the extent of the clipped raster to the extent of the
   mask layer**

-  Tick \ **set the output file resolution**

-  Type the \ **X and Y resolution in metres** (in this case 832)

-  Tick \ **Use Input Layer Data Type**

-  Set the output \ **Clipped (mask)** e.g. to Mountains\_Colombia.tif

|image13|

|image14|

-  **Click Run** to run the tool

The new clipped mountain descriptor dataset in the national projection
should be added to the map canvas\ **.**

|image15|

-  Right click on the clipped mountain dataset (i.e. in this example the
   Mountains\_Colombia layer) and click \ **properties>>Symbology**

-  Click on **Style >> Load Style, and select the**
   SDG1542\_Mntn\_BioclimaticBelts.qml included in the Global Descriptor
   Dataset Folder

|image16|

The layer should now show all the mountain area for Colombia classified
by Biolimatic belts (where 1 is ‘’Nival”, 2 is “Alpine”, 3 is ‘’Montane”
and 4 is “Remaining Mountain Area”.

|image17|

 Generate the vegetation descriptor layer
-----------------------------------------

To demonstrate the steps for processing a raster LULC dataset we will
use the Global ESA CCI LULC dataset. If you are using a national
dataset, you can skip the following step.

`Clip and project LULC raster <https://mgci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qgis.html#id23>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ESA CCI LULC dataset is provided in netcdf (.nc) format. Similarly
to Geotiffs, these can be added directly to QGIS.

-  From the QGIS main toolbar click on Layer>>Add Layer>>Add Raster
   Layer to add the LULC file to your QGIS session.

|image9|

|image18|

-  Click \ **Add**

For most formats this will add the LULC dataset to the QGIS session. The
Global ESA CCI LULC netcdf file however contains 7 different layers
(similar to bands in an image) and users need to select
the lccs\_class layer.

-  Click \ **lccs\_class** to select the LULC layer

-  Click \ **OK** and the LULC layer will be added to your QGIS project

-  Click \ **Close** to close the Data Source Manager: Raster dialogue
   window

|image19|

Next check that the LULC layer has correct projection information and
appears in the correct place in the QGIS project.

-  First check that the LULC layer is correctly overlaying the country
   boundary data. If it does not your country boundary and/or your LULC
   layer may be lacking projection information or have the wrong
   projection information.

|image20|

-  QGIS will display a ‘’\ **?’’** next to the layer if projection
   information is missing.

-  If projection information is missing define the projection using
   the \ **Define Shapefile projection** tool in the processing toolbox
   (this will permanently attach projection information to the layer)
   alternatively you can just define it within the current QGIS project
   by right clicking on the layer.

In this example we know the LULC is in Geographic coordinate system so
we can assign coordinate system EPSG 4326 to the layer

|image21|

-  This layer should now draw correctly on the country boundary.

If the LULC dataset is a regional or global extent it will need
projecting and clipping to the AOI.

In this example we are using a global dataset so we will need to clip
the raster and save it in the equal area projection.

-  In the processing toolbox search for \ **Clip**

-  Double click on the \ **Clip raster by mask layer** under the GDAL
   toolset

|image12|

-  Select the **LULC dataset** for the input layer

-  Select the \ **national border of the country** for the \ **Mask
   Layer**

-  Select the \ **Project CRS** for the \ **Target CRS**

-  Tick \ **Match the extent of the clipped raster to the extent of the
   mask layer**

-  Tick \ **set the output file resolution**

-  Type the \ **X and Y resolution in metres** (in this case the
   resolution of the LULC dataset is 300)

-  Tick \ **Use Input Layer Data Type**

-  Set the output \ **Clipped (mask)** e.g. to LULC\_2020\_Colombia.tif
   (see screengrab below)

|image22|

|image23|

-  **Click Run** to run the tool

The new clipped LULC dataset in the equal area projection should be
added should be added to the map canvas\ **.** LULC\_2020\_Colombia
layer) and click \ **properties>>Symbology**

|image24|

-  Change the render type to \ **Palleted/Unique Values**

-  Click \ **Classify** and then \ **OK**

You should now see the unique LULC classes present within the AOI for
the country.

|image25|

Reclassify to UN-SEEA land cover classes
----------------------------------------

The next step is to reclassify the LULC map into the 10 UN-SEEA classes
defined for SDG Indicator 15.4.2

QGIS provides several tools for reclassification. The easiest one to use
in this instance is the \ **r.reclass** tool in the GRASS toolset as it
allows the upload of a simple crosswalk textfile containing the input
LULC types on the left and the UN-SEEA reclass values on the right.

-  Create a text file to crosswalk landuse/landcover (LULC) types from
   the ESA CCI or National landcover dataset to the 10 UN-SEEA landcover
   classes

|image26|

-  Search for \ **reclass** in the processing toolbox

|image27|

-  Double click on \ **r.reclass**

-  Select the LULC output as the \ **input raster layer**

-  Set the \ **GRASS GIS region extent** to be the same as the input
   layer

-  Set the \ **Reclassified** output e.g.
   VegetationDescriptor\_Colombia.tif

|image28|

-  Click \ **Run** to run the tool. The
   new \ **VegetationDescriptor** layer is added to the map.

Although the reclassification only had 6 output classes the symbology
initially show values 0-255. This is a QGIS visualisation only and you
can see that the actual layer only has 10 values.

-  Right click on the layer \ **properties>>>Symbology**

-  Change the Render type to \ **Palleted/Unique values** and
   click \ **Classify** to see only the classes present in the raster
   (i.e. the 1-10 Vegetation descriptor classes) and rename the classes
   following the UN-SEEA terminology. Give each class a distinctive and
   identifiable colour.

|image29|

 Combine mountain and vegetation descriptor layers
--------------------------------------------------

Now that we have 2 raster datasets in their native resolutions we need
to bring the datasets together and ensure that correct aggregation is
undertaken and that the all the layers align to a common resolution.

Aggregate the layers to a common spatial resolution
---------------------------------------------------

In this example we have the Mountain Descriptor layer at a 832 meters
resolution and a vegetation descriptor layer at a 300 m resolution.
There are various tools that can be used but we have opted for the GRASS
tool **r.resample** as it allowed to resample the mountain descriptor to
the vegetation layer, which has a finer grid.

In the processing toolbox search for \ **\*r.resample\***

|image30|

-  Select the mountain descriptor (in this example
   **Mountains\_Colombia.tif)** as the \ **Input Layer**

-  Set the cellsize to the the same resolution as your Vegetation
   Descriptor layer e.g. in this example 300m

-  Set the \ **Resampled Aggregated** layer to a name that distinguishes
   the resampling of the layer e.g. \ **Mountains\_Colombia\_300.tif**

-  Click \ **Run** to run the tool

|image31|

Combine mountain and vegetation descriptor layers
-------------------------------------------------

As SGD Indicator 15.4.2a requires disaggregation by both the 10 land
cover classes and the 4 bioclimatic belts and the tools within QGIS will
only allow a single input for zones, we will combine the two datasets.

-  In the \ **processing toolbox**, search for and double click on
   the \ **raster calculator**

-  In the expression window we will sum the two dataset together but in
   order to distinguish the vegetation class from the mountain all the
   vegetation values will be multiplied by 10. This means for example a
   value of 35 in the output means the pixel has class 3 in the
   vegetation descriptor layer and class 5 in the Mountain descriptor
   layer.

-  In the expression box formulate the expression:

(“VEGETATION\_DESCRIPTOR@1”`\* <https://mgci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qgis.html#id5>`__\ 10)
+ “MoutainDescriptor@1”

|image32|

-  Set the Reference layer as the Vegetation Descriptor layer

-  Click \ **Run** to run the tool

|image33|

1. .. rubric:: Computation of Mountain Green Cover Index
      :name: computation-of-mountain-green-cover-index

2. .. rubric:: Generate area statistics for each land cover class
      :name: generate-area-statistics-for-each-land-cover-class

The data are now in a consistent format, so we can now generate the
statistics required for the MGCI reporting. As we want to generate
disaggregated statistics by LULC class and bioclimatic belt we will use
a zonal statistics tool with the combined Vegetation + mountain layer as
the summary unit. The Zonal statistics tool will automatically calculate
planimetric area in the output.

This output is the main statistics table from the analysis, from which
other summary statistics tables will be generated.

-  In the \ **processing toolbox** search for Zonal Statistics

-  Double click on the Raster layer unique values report.

-  Set the input layer to the combined vegetation and mountain class
   layer created in the previous step.

-  Under the Unique values table click on ... and choose Save to File….
   Enter a name for the file, in this case LULC\_Areas\_COL\_2020.gpkg.

-  Click \ **Run**.

|image34|

Now the LULC\_Areas\_COL\_2020  layer will be added to the Layers panel.
Right-click on the layer and click \ **Open Attribute Table**. The
column m2 contains the area for each class in square meters.

|image35|

Let’s convert the area to square kilometers. In the Processing Toolbox,
search and select \ **Vector table >> Field Calculator.**

-  In the Field Calculator dialog, select the LULC\_Areas\_COL\_2020
   layer

-  Enter the Field name as Area\_sqkm. 

-  In the Result field type choose **Float  **

-  In the Expression window, enter the below expression. This will
   convert the sqmt to sqkm and round the result to 2 decimal places.
   Under the Calculated click on **…** and choose Save To File… . Enter
   the name as LULC\_Areas\_COL\_2020\_sqkm.csv

   round("m2"/1e6, 2)

-  Click \ **Run.**

|image36|

Now the **LULC\_Areas\_COL\_2020\_sqkm** will be loaded in canvas. Open
the Attribute table and examine the newly added area\_sqkm column. You
will notice that the Value column contains numbers for each class. To
make the results easier to interpret. Let’s also add the land cover name
for each class number

In the Attribute Table, select “\ **Open** **Field Calculator”** in the
top bar.

-  Enter the Field name as Land\_cover.

-  In the Result field type, choose String. In Output field length enter
   100.

-  In the Expression window enter the below expression. This expression
   uses the \ **CASE** statement to assign a value based on multiple
   conditions. In this case it extract the first string of the value
   field, which indicate the type of land cover, to assign the name of
   the land cover in the new field name called “Land cover”

CASE

WHEN (substr("value",1,2))=10 THEN 'Inland water bodies'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=1 THEN 'Artificial Surfaces'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=2 THEN 'Cropland'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=3 THEN 'Grassland'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=4 THEN 'Tree-covered areas'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=5 THEN 'Shrub-covered areas'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=6 THEN 'Shrubs and/or herbaceous vegetation,
aquatic or regularly flooded'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=7 THEN 'Sparsely natural vegetated areas'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=8 THEN 'Terrestrial barren land'

WHEN (substr("value",1,1))=9 THEN 'Permanent snow and glaciers'

END

-  Click \ **Run.**

|image37|\ |image38|

Do the same again to add the Bioclimatic belt for each end string for
each value number, using the below expression:

|image39|

CASE

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=1 THEN 'Nival'

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=2 THEN 'Alpine'

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=3 THEN 'Montane'

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=4 THEN 'Remaining Mountain Area'

WHEN (substr("value",3,1))=1 THEN 'Nival'

WHEN (substr("value",3,1))=2 THEN 'Alpine'

WHEN (substr("value",3,1))=3 THEN 'Montane'

WHEN (substr("value",3,1))=4 THEN 'Remaining Mountain Area'

END

Save the edits.

Now, we will export this result as an excel file. Before export we will
also organize the table and remove unwanted fields. In the Processing
Toolbox, search and select \ **Vector table ‣ Refactor fields**.

In the Refactor Fields dialog, select the layer edited in the prior step
as an Input layer (in this case LULC\_Areas\_COL\_2020\_SQKM), select
all columns except *area\_sqkm*, *Land\_cover*, *Bioclimatic\_belt* and
then click Delete selected field.

Once you are done with the edits, click on the ... button next
to Refactored and choose Save To File…. Select XLSX Files (\*.xlsx) as
the format. Enter the file name as 15.4.2a\_2020.xlsx and click Save. In
the Refactor Fields dialog, click Run to apply your changes.

|image40|

The result will be a spreadheet with *area\_sqkm* , land\_cover and
Bioclimatic\_belt columns.

|image41|

In Excel, calculate: (1) the total area of each bioclimatic belt (by
summing the area of all land cover types per bioclimatic belt); (2) the
total area of each land cover type across all bioclimatic belts (by
summing the area of each specific land cover type across all bioclimatic
belts) and finally; (3) the total mountain area of the country (by
summing the area of all land cover types across all bioclimatic belts).

Save this excel tab as 15.4.2a\_dis\_landcover. This data contains the
estimates of 15.4.2 sub-indicator a, disaggregated by land cover type.
Let’s now calculate the Mountain Green Cover Index estimates.

Copy and paste the values of this tab into another tab. In this one,
calculate Green Cover area for each bioclimatic belt, by summing the
areas of the following land cover types: (1) Tree-covered areas, (2)
Grasslands, (3) Croplands, (4) Shrub-covered areas and (5) Shubs and/or
herbaceous vegetation, aquatic or regularly flooded.

|image42|

Finally, calculate the MGCI by diving the area of green cover the total
area of each bioclimatic belt and the total mountain area and
multiplying it by 100.

|image43|

Sub-indicator a is now complete.

Repeat for each of the reporting years.

This section of the tutorial explains in detail how to calculate value
estimates for sub-indicator 15.4.2b in QGIS, continuing to use Colombia
as a case study. Sub-Indicator 15.4.2b is designed to monitor the extent
of degraded mountain land as a result of land cover change of a given
country and for given reporting year.

This sub-indicator looks at the proportion of degraded mountain area,
calculated using a binary score (degraded/non-degraded) showing the
extent of degraded land over total mountain area. This is calculated
using the following formula:

countries are required to compute estimates for Sub-Indicator 15.4.2b
for a baseline for approximately 2000-2015, and subsequently every three
years (2018, 2021, 2024, 2027 and 2030). Therefore, for the example in
this tutorial we will use the ESA-CCI landcover products for 2000, 2015
(for the baseline) and 2018 (for the reporting year). ESA-CCI landcover
data are not yet available beyond 2021 so we have therefore not yet been
able to calculate subsequent years in this example.

This section of the tutorial assumes that the user has already
calculated sub-indicator 15.4.2a and has therefore already downloaded
and translated the landcover cover datasets to UN-SEEA classes for the
baseline and reporting years (see sections 3.1-3.3 of the tutorial) as
presented in the figure below).

**LULC reclassified into UN-SEEA classes for 2000, 2015 and 2018**

   1. .. rubric:: Generate LULC degradation layers for reporting periods
         :name: generate-lulc-degradation-layers-for-reporting-periods

SGD Indicator 15.4.2b requires us to identify change between LC classes
in each reporting period, therefore the first requirement for
sub-indicator 15.4.2b is to develop a transition matrix that specifies
the land cover changes occurring in a given land unit (pixel) as being
either degradation, improvement or neutral transitions. The definition
of degradation adopted for the computation of this indicator is the one
established by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) [2]_.

Countries may choose to either calculate degradation using the default
land cover legend for this indicator and default transition matrix
provided or from a native or simplified legend of a national land
use/land cover (LULC) dataset if they have the advantage of better
representing degradation transitions compared to the broader default
transitions.

Section 4.1.1 describes the default method using the default legend and
transition matrix, while section 4.1.2 outlines the
additional/alternative steps required to generate a transitions matrix
using a nationally adapted land cover legend. In both cases the output
results in the same 3 classes (stable, degradation and improving) and
both needed to be disaggregated and reported by both landcover
transition and bioclimatic belt.

The easiest method in QGIS is to generate a single value that represents
both year1 landcover and year2 landcover. For example, when calculating
the baseline using the default land cover legend reclassified datasets
for 2000 and 2015, each dataset has LULC values from 1-10 we need to
change the values for one of the years to be able to distinguish between
classes in year1 and year2. When using the nationally adapted LULC
legend, the values may be greater than 1-10. We will therefore multiply
values in year 1 by 1000 (in order to avoid any overlap between the
values in year 2).

Combine the landcover dataset for the baseline and reporting year
-----------------------------------------------------------------

First, we will generate a single raster containing a value to represent
both year1 landcover and year2 landcover. We will demonstrate using the
default method using the UN-SEEA reclassified landcover raster’s in
equal area projection that were previously reclassified for the
computation of sub-indicator a. As indicated above, users can choose to
use the rasters projected to equal area projection containing the full
or a simplified national LULC legend if there is a preference/advantage
of calculating landcover transitions compared to using the default
legend and transition matrix. The processing is the same regardless
which method is chosen.

In this example we will use the UN-SEEA reclassified landcover datasets
for 2000 and 2015 for the baseline and UN-SEEA classified landcover 2015
to 2018 raster’s for the 2018 reporting year. As each dataset has the
same LULC values (values 1-10 for UN-SEEA classification) we need to
change the values in one of the years to be able to distinguish between
classes in year1 and year2. We will multiply year1 land cover classes by
1000 before summing the datasets together. So for example values for
year 1 when using the default legend will range from 1000 – 10000 and
values for year 2 will remain 1 -10 and the resultant output will have
values ranging from a minimum of 1001 to a maximum of 10010 (depending
on which LULC transitions are present).

We will calculate the baseline period first i.e. using 2000 landcover
(year 1) and 2015 landcover (year2)

-  In the \ **processing toolbox**, search for and double click on
   the \ **raster calculator**

-  In the **expression box** formulate the expression (in this example
   using the UN-SEEA datasets):

(“UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_BND\_AOI\_EqArea@1”`\* <https://mgci-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qgis.html#id5>`__\ 1000)
+ “UNSEEA\_LULC2015\_BND\_AOI\_EqArea@1”

|image46|

-  |image47|\ Set the Reference layer as one of the landcover datasets
   to set the extent, cellsize and CRS e.g.
   **UNSEEA\_LULC2015\_BND\_AOI\_EqArea layer**

-  Set the Output dataset to a new name e.g.
   **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_BND\_AOI\_EqArea.tif** for the baseline

-  Click \ **Run** to run the tool

When using the default UN-SEEA land cover legend, this means that a
value of 2001 means a land cover class 2 in year 1 and a land cover
class 1 in year 2. A value of 10010 would mean a land cover class 10 in
year 1 and a land cover class 10 in year 2. In other words, year 1 is
represented by the first digit for values 1 to 9, and by the first 2
digits for land cover class 10. Year 2, on the other hand, is
represented by the right hand digit (for values 1-9) and the right hand
2 digits for value 10.

Repeat the above step for the next reporting period i.e. using 2015
landcover (year 1) and 2018 landcover (year2)

Download the default transitions matrix csv file from the `GitHub
repository <https://github.com/sepal-contrib/sepal_mgci/blob/master/component/parameter/transition_matrix.csv>`__
showing the unique combination of transitions using the default UN-SEEA
classes as presented in the figure below. The default transitions matrix
lists the transitions from the LULC classes to the 3 change classes
Stable (0), Degradation (-1) and Improving (1).

|image48|

-  Download the transitions matrix csv file and add it to your QGIS
   project using **Layer>>Add Layer>>Add Delimited Text Layer**

|image49|

Despite the clarity of this format transitions matrix, the
reclassification tools in QGIS require a very specific format for the
reclassification table. We therefore need to add an additional field and
calculate it to be the required QGIS syntax. This field will then be
saved into a new CSV file which can be used by the QGIS geoprocessing
tool.

-  In the Geoprocessing toolbox search for **Field Calculator**

In the field calculator add a new **string** field called
**QGIS\_syntax** with length **30**.

In the **expression builder** paste in the following text. Note that we
are taking the Landcover code for year 1 and multiplying it by 1000 (as
described above) and summing it with the landcover code for year 2
before combining it with the rest of the QGIS syntax

("from\_code" \*1000 + "to\_code") \|\| ' = ' \|\| "impact\_code" \|\| '
' \|\| "impact"

|image50|

The resultant table should look like this:

|image51|

-  Next search for the **List unique values** tool in the geoprocessing
   toolbox, this will be used to export the new column, **QGIS\_syntax**
   to a new csv file

-  Select the **transitions\_matrix\_QGIS** as the input layer

-  |image52|\ Select the **QGIS\_syntax** field in the target field

|image53|

-  Save the unique values to a new csv file e.g.
   **transition\_matrix\_for\_qgis.csv**

-  Click **Run**

-  Outside QGIS, open a windows explorer window navigate to the csv file
   and open in notepad

-  Remove the header row and save the file as
   **transition\_matrix\_for\_qgis.txt**

-  **Return to QGIS**

         :name: generate-a-transitions-matrix-using-a-national-lulc-legend

If are using a national land cover transition matrix you can prepare a
transitions table in the same format as the default transitions table in
Excel or you can generate a csv file from the unique combinations for
the LULC types using the combined LULC dataset for the two years. We
illustrate this below (although we are using the default UN-SEEA classes
for illustration purposes only)

-  In the processing toolbox search for **Raster Layer** **Unique Values
   Report**

-  Select the combined LULC dataset for year 1 and year 2 as the input
   layer e.g. **SEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_BND\_AOI\_EqArea.tif**

-  Set the Unique values report to a new output table **e.g.
   UNSEAA\_2000\_20015\_trans.csv**

|image54|

The resultant table looks like this:

|image55|

Delete the count and m2 columns by clicking on the **toggle editing
button** on the top menu bar of the attribute table and then click the
Delete Field button. Select the **“\ *count”*** and **“\ *m2***\ *”*
fields and click **OK** to delete

|image56| |image57|

-  Click \ **OK.**

-  The result looks like this

-  Next click the **New Field** button to add the following 2 fields

    |image67| |image68|

Users can then either manually enter the impact (stable, degradation or
improving) and impact\_codes (0,-1,1) or use the select button to select
groups of transitions and calculate to particular impact types

e.g. select those landcover types that have not changed between year 1
and year 2 and calculate as impact code = 0 and impact = “stable”

-  Click on the **Select features** **using and expression** button

|image69|

-  In the expression box enter the expression **“from\_code” =
   “to\_code”**

-  Click **Select features**

|image70|

The selected features are highlighted in blue:

|image71|

-  Click on the **Open field calculator** button

-  Tick **Update existing field**

-  Choose the **impact** field

-  In the expression box type **‘stable’**

-  Click **OK**

|image72|

-  |image73|\ Click on the **Open field calculator** button again

-  Tick **Update existing field**

-  Choose the field **impact\_code**

-  In the expression box type **0**

-  Click **OK**

|image74|\ The selected features highlighted in blue are now populated:

**Once all the impact values are populated,** we need to add an
additional field as the reclassification tools in QGIS that will use the
transitions matrix require a very specific format for the
reclassification table. This field will then be saved into a new CSV
file which can be used by the QGIS geoprocessing tool.

-  Click on the **Open field calculator** button

    In the field calculator add a new **string** field called
    **QGIS\_syntax** with length **30**.

    In the **expression window** paste in the following text. Note that
    we are taking the Landcover code for year 1 and multiplying it by
    1000 (as described above) and summing it with the landcover code for
    year 2 before combining it with the rest of the QGIS syntax:

    **("from\_code" \*1000 + "to\_code") \|\| ' = ' \|\| "impact\_code"
    \|\| ' ' \|\| "impact"**

    |image75|

-  Click **OK**

The resultant table should look like this:

|image76|

-  Next search for the **List unique values** tool in the geoprocessing
   toolbox, this will be used to export the new column, **QGIS\_syntax**
   to a new csv file

-  Select the **UNSEA\_2000\_2015\_trans** as the input layer

-  Select the **QGIS\_synta**\ x field in the target field

|image77| |image52|

-  Save the unique values to a new csv file e.g.
   **transition\_matrix\_nat\_for\_qgis.csv**

-  Click **Run**

***Important*** ***Note:** Be careful if using this same table for other
time periods as it is based on transitions between two specified time
periods. E.g. in this case 2000 and 2015. There may be other possible
transitions that are not present in this time period but may be possible
for other years. Therefore, before using this transitions matrix for
other time periods either check for missing entries and manually add
them to this table or generate a new transitions table for the new time
period.*

Reclassify LULC transitions using the transitions matrix
--------------------------------------------------------

The next step is to reclassify the outputs from step 5.2 (i.e. the
combined landcover datasets for year1 and year 2), first for the
baseline period **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea.tif** and **then for
the 2018 reporting period UNSEEA\_LULC2015\_2018\_EqArea.tif.** We will
use the transitions matrix generated in the previous steps (5.3.1 or
5.3.2). In this example we use the default transitions matrix (from
5.3.1) but the steps are the same if a national transitions matrix is
being used.

-  In the processing toolbox search **for r.reclass**

-  Set the input raster layer to **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea.tif**

-  Set the file containing the reclass rules by navigating to the
   transitions matrix e.g. **transition\_matrix\_for\_qgis.csv**

-  Set the GRASS GIS 7 Region extent to
   **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea.tif**

-  Set the cellsize to be the same as UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea.tif
   e.g. in this case **307.896977**

-  Save the reclassified file to a new name e.g.
   **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea\_reclassed\_impact.tif**

   |image78|

-  Click **Run**

   **(you can the two ignore the 2 warning messages that appear in red–
   these do not affect the correct generation of the outputs**

   **“**\ WARNING: Concurrent mapset locking is not supported on
   Windows”

   **“**\ ERROR 6:
   C:\\workspace\\MGCI\\outputs\\UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea\_reclassed\_impact.tif,

-  Double-click on the output and change the symbology to
   **paletted/unique** values and click the **Classify** button to show
   the classes present in the output layer.

   |image79|

   (you can also change the label to indicate 0 = stable -1 =
   degradation and 1 = improving)

   |image80|

-  Repeat the above step for the next reporting period i.e. using 2015
   landcover (year 1) and 2018 landcover (year2) i.e. using the layer
   **UNSEEA\_LULC2015\_2018\_EqArea.tif**

         belts
         :name: combine-landcover-transitions-impact-and-bioclimatic-belts

We now have all the layers we need for generating statistics. To make it
easier we will again sum the layers together using different factors to
change the values in some of the datasets.

We have the following datasets which we need to combine to generate the
proportion of degraded mountain area disaggregated by LULC transitions,
impact status and bioclimatic belt:

-  LULC transitions (which in our case using have values 1001-10010
   where LULC for year 1 has already been multiplied by 1000 and summed
   with year 2 values)

   **We will leave these LULC transitions dataset values as they are. **

-  Bioclimatic belts (which have values 1-4 representing the 4
   bioclimatic belts)

   **We will multiply the bioclimatic belts by 100,000**

-  LULC transition impact status (values -1, 0 and 1)

   **We will change the impact status by adding 2 to each of the values
   and multiplying by 1,000,000 thus changing values -1 to 1,000,000
   (degradation) 0 to 2,000,000 (stable) and 1 to 3,000,000
   (improving)**

-  In the processing toolbox search for the **raster calculator **

-  In the expression box use the following expression (where the first
   dataset is the LULC transitions e.g. in this example for the baseline
   period, the second dataset is the Bioclimatic Belts dataset that was
   resampled to the resolution of the LULC dataset in the processing for
   sub-indicator a and the third dataset is the impact status):

   "UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea@1" +
   ("MNTBelts\_BND\_AOI\_ResampledNN\_EqArea@1" \*100000) +
   (("UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea\_reclassed\_impact@1" +2)\*1000000)

   |image81|

-  Set the reference dataset as the UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_EqArea@1
   which is a quick way to determine the output extent, cellsize and
   projection of the output dataset.

-  Set the output dataset as e.g.
   **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_MTN\_combined\_.tif**

-  |image82|\ Click **Run.** The output is added to the table of
   contents and the annotated legend below illustrates the meanings of
   the values

   e.g. **UNSEEA\_LULC2000\_2015\_MTN\_combined\_.tif**.

-  Under the Unique values table click on ... and choose Save to File….
   Enter a name for the file, in this case
   **subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015.gpkg**.

   |image84|

-  Click \ **Run**.

Now the **subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015** layer will be
added to the Layers panel. Right-click on the layer and click \ **Open
Attribute Table**. The column m2 contains the area for each class in
square meters.

|image85|

Let’s convert the area to square kilometers. In the Processing Toolbox,
search and select \ **Vector table >> Field Calculator.**

-  In the Field Calculator dialog, select
   the \ **subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015** layer

-  Enter the Field name as **Area\_sqkm**. 

-  In the Result field type choose **Float  **

-  In the Expression window, enter the below expression. This will
   convert the sqmt to sqkm and round the result to 2 decimal places.
   Under the Calculated click on **…** and choose Save To File… . Enter
   the name as **subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015\_sqkm**

   round("m2"/1e6, 2)

|image86|

-  Click \ **Run.**

Now the **subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015\_sqkm** will be
loaded in canvas. Open the Attribute table and examine the newly
added area\_sqkm column.

As indicated before the Value column contains numbers for each unique
class combination. To make the results easier to interpret. Let’s also
re-add all the descriptive attributes

In the Attribute Table, click the “\ **Open** **Field Calculator”**
button in the top bar.

-  Enter the Field name as **BioclimaticBelt**.

-  In the Result field type, choose **Text (string).** In Output field
   length enter **100**.

-  In the Expression window enter the below expression. This expression
   uses the \ **CASE** statement to assign a value based on multiple
   conditions. In this case it extracts the second string of the value
   field, which indicate the type of land cover, to assign the name of
   the land cover in the new field name called “\ **BioclimaticBelt”**

   CASE

   WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=1 THEN 'Nival'

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=2 THEN 'Alpine'

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=3 THEN 'Montane'

WHEN (substr("value",2,1))=4 THEN 'Remaining Mountain Area'

END

|image87|

-  Click on the Save button on the attribute menu to save the edits.

In the Attribute Table, click the “\ **Open** **Field Calculator”**
button in the top bar again.

-  Enter the Field name as **LULC\_transition**.

-  In the Result field type, choose **Whole Number (Integer).**.

-  In the Expression window enter the expression: substr("value",3,5)

   |image88|

-  Click **OK**

-  Click on the **Save** button on the attribute menu to save the edits.

-  Click on the **toggle editing** button to turn off the attribute
   editing

We can now use the LULC\_transitions field to join on the rest of the
attributes from the transitions matrix file.

-  Open the transitions\_matrix\_for\_QGIS.csv file . It should be the
   one containing the following fields. We are going to use the
   **Value** field in this file to join to the **LULC\_transition**
   field in our statistic file
   (subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015\_sqkm)

|image89|

-  Right click and select properties on the statistics file

   i.e. **subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015\_sqkm**

-  Click on the **joins tab** and click on the **green + button**

-  For the join layer pick the **transitions matrix** that you opened
   above

-  For the join field pick **Value**

-  For the target field pick **LULC\_transition**

|image90|

-  Click **OK** then **OK** again

-  You should see that a join has been added in the top panel

   |image91|

-  Click **OK** to close the join window

-  Open the attribute table of the statistics file again and you should
   now see that it includes the joined fields. (i.e. the
   subIndicator\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015\_sqkm file\ **)**

   |image92|

-  These are only temporarily joined so we need to save as a new file.
   We will use the refactor field tool as this allows us to remove the
   joinfield preface (in this example
   **transition\_matrix\_for\_qgis\_**)that was added to the joined on
   fields and also set the correct output types for the other fields (as
   below)

|image93|

-  Save the refactored file to a new name within the geopackage

   e.g. subInd\_b\_Areas\_COL\_basline2000\_2015\_sqkm\_joined

         reporting format
         :name: calculate-area-statistics-and-format-statistics-to-reporting-format

-  From the main menu click on **Plugins>>Manage and install plugins**

-  Search for **stats** and click on **Group Stats** then click on
   **Install Plugin**

|image94|

-  From the main menu bar click on **Vector>> Groupstats >> Group
   stats**

|image95|

-  Drag the **Area\_sqkm** field into the **Value** box

-  Drag **sum** into the Value box

-  Drag **BioclimaticBelt,** and **to\_desc** into the **Rows** box

-  Drag **impact** into the **Columns** box

-  Click **Calculate**

|image96|

A summary table will appear in the **Group Stats** window

-  From the Group stats menu click **Data>>copy all to clipboard**

-  Next open **Microsoft Excel** with a new blank worksheet

-  **Paste** the copied clipboard contents into the excel worksheet

   |image97|

-  Highlight the headings **Degradation, Improving and Stable** and
   shift them down one cell

-  Highlight the entire first row and delete (with the heading None and
   impact)

-  Add 3 new columns at the end called **Total, ProportionDegraded,
   ProportionNetDegraded, %Degraded and %NetDegraded.**

   |image98|

-  Calculate Total to be the sum of colums C to E

-  Calculate ProportionDegraded to be column C dived by column F

-  Calculate ProportionNetDegraded to be column C minus column D and
   diving it by column F

-  Calculate %Degraded and %Net Degraded to be column G and H multiplied
   by 100, respectively.

    |image99|

-  **Next insert pivot table and summarise by Bioclimatic Belt to sum
   the Degradation values, Improving values and Total Mountain Area**

   |image100|

-  Again add and calculate columns for **ProportionDegraded,
   ProportionNetDegraded, %Degraded and %NetDegraded**

-  Save to **.xlsx format e.g. COL\_2000\_2015\_SDG15\_4\_2b.xls**

-  Repeat the above step for the next reporting period i.e. using 2015
   landcover (year 1) and 2018 landcover (year2) and any other reporting
   periods.
